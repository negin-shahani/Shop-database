# Shop-database description:
This is my final project for database management course.
We designed a database for a online store using SQL server.
## Project steps:
In the first step, we determined the requirements of the database project. To determine the needs of the project, we first checked the available online stores, and also a member of the group inquired about several stores by inquiring from several employees of the Kourosh store. We then designed an online questionnaire based on the information we obtained.
After designing the questionnaire, we provided the link of the questionnaire to the people through the employees of the store and social networks in a random way. And through the website itself, we monitored the participation rate and the completed questionnaires. Then, according to the given answers and plotting, we analyzed the requirements and determined the entities and attributes that each entity should have.
We drew the ER and relational diagrams for each entity so that we could determine the relationships between the entities well. And to prevent redundancy and structural problems and anomalies, we brought the tables to the third level of normalization. Then, based on the tables, entities and relationships between them, we implemented a database in SQL format.
We appended meaningful data tables to test our database before submission, and after completing the project steps, we wrote a report on the work done and the steps taken in the project.
